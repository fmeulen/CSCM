# Current Status Continuous Marks
Bayesian computation for the current status continuous marks model. 
Formerly this package was called CSCM, as this is too cryptic, it has been changed to a more informative name. 

TBA: Detailed information.

A few examples have been implemented; the code for the Dirichlet prior and graph-Laplacian prior is generic; simply run "main.jl".
